# APUENotes and code from APUE (Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment, 2nd Edition).The book can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Environment-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0321525949).Source code can be found [here](http://www.apuebook.com/code2e.html).## Code Layout`/APUE/apue.2e` (compiled [source code](http://www.apuebook.com/code2e.html))`/APUE/chx` (my notes for chapter x)## How to compileI have compiled the source code on MAC. Suppose you just obtain the [source code](http://www.apuebook.com/code2e.html), then follow the [instrctions] (https://github.com/y-c/APUE/blob/master/apue.2e/README) to compile. If you are using MAC and it complains:`Undefined symbols for architecture x86\_64:   "\_CMSG\_LEN", referenced from:              _recv_fd in libapue.a(recvfd.o)                ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64               clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)`Simply add `-D\_DARWIN\_C\_SOURCE` into `Make.defines.macos` will resolve the issue.  ## How to run your own codeSuppose you have written your own `file.c` in the folder `APUE/ch1`, go to the folder and `gcc -o a file.c -L. ../apue.2e/lib/libapue.a`
